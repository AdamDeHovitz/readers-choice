## 🚀 Self-Hosting Guide

Want to run your own instance of Readers' Choice? Follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm
- **Supabase** account (free tier available)
- **Google Cloud** account for OAuth (free)
- **Vercel** account for deployment (optional, free tier available)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdamDeHovitz/readers-choice.git
cd readers-choice
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase

1. Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to **Project Settings > API** and copy:
   - Project URL (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`)
   - `service_role` key (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) — keep this secret; it is only used server-side

3. Create the database schema by applying the migrations in `supabase/migrations/` in filename (version) order. The recommended way is the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli), which also records each version in the project's migration history:

   ```bash
   supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>
   supabase db push
   ```

   Alternatively, paste each file into the dashboard **SQL Editor** in order (this does not record migration history). Deploying the app never runs migrations, so apply new ones whenever you pull schema changes.

4. **Security model**: the app only talks to Supabase from server code using the service-role key, which bypasses Row Level Security, and NextAuth does not set `auth.uid()`. **Authorization is enforced in the app's server actions**, not by RLS. The migrations still enable RLS and lock down sensitive tables so that the public API exposes nothing useful — there is no extra RLS setup to do.

### 3. Set Up Google OAuth

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable **Google+ API**
4. Go to **Credentials** → **Create Credentials** → **OAuth client ID**
5. Choose **Web application** and add:
   - **Authorized JavaScript origins**: `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
   - **Authorized redirect URIs**:
     - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` (development)
     - `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google` (production)
6. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 4. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# NextAuth
AUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret_string  # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=your_google_oauth_client_secret

# App URL (for OAuth callbacks)
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Change to your production URL when deploying
```

### 5. Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your app!

### 6. Deploy to Vercel (Optional)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import your repository on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. Add all environment variables from `.env.local`
4. Update `NEXTAUTH_URL` to your Vercel deployment URL
5. Update Google OAuth redirect URIs to include your Vercel domain

## 📚 Database Schema

The application uses PostgreSQL with the following main tables:

- **users** - User accounts and profiles
- **book_clubs** - Book club information
- **members** - Club membership and admin status
- **meetings** - Scheduled and past meetings
- **themes** / **theme_votes** - Meeting themes and their upvotes
- **books** - Book metadata from APIs
- **book_options** - Books nominated for meetings (with per-meeting metadata overrides)
- **votes** / **meeting_ranked_votes** / **meeting_voting_preferences** - Approval and ranked-choice ballots
- **personal_rankings** - Personal year-based book rankings
- **invite_links** - Shareable club invite codes

See `database-schema.md` for an overview; `supabase/migrations/` is the source of truth.
