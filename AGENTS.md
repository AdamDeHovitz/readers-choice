# Agent Instructions

## Build & Testing Requirements

Before committing and pushing any changes, you MUST:

1. Run the build command to ensure the code compiles without errors:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Fix any TypeScript errors, linting issues, or build failures

3. Only commit and push once the build passes successfully

## Commands

- **Development**: `npm run dev`
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Lint**: `npm run lint` (if available)

## Notes

- The project uses Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled
- All code must pass type checking before being committed
