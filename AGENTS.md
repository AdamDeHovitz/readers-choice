## 4. Architecture & Key Files

### Directory Structure
- `app/`: Next.js App Router (Pages & Layouts).
- `app/actions/`: Server Actions (Mutations). **Use these for DB writes.**
- `components/`: UI Components.
    - `ui/`: shadcn/ui primitives.
    - `book-clubs/`, `meetings/`: Feature-specific components.
- `lib/`: Utilities.
    - `supabase/`: DB Clients.
- `supabase/migrations/`: SQL Source of Truth.

### Key Routes
- `/dashboard`: User's club list.
- `/book-clubs/[id]`: Club hub (Members, Meetings).
- `/book-clubs/[id]/rankings`: Personal Year Rankings.
- `/book-clubs/[id]/global-rankings`: Community Favorites.

## 5. Design & Style Guidelines
*Refer to `STYLE.md` and `DESIGN_GUIDE.md` for full details.*

*   **Visuals**: Use `font-voga` (headings) and `font-inria` (body).
    *   Primary: `bg-rust-600` (Buttons).
    *   Accent: `bg-gold-600` (Nav/Active).
    *   Background: `bg-cream-100`.
*   **Coding**:
    *   **Server Components** by default.
    *   **Server Actions** for all data mutations.
    *   **Strict Types**: No `any`. Define interfaces in `types/` or co-located if small.

## 6. Development Workflow
1.  **Analyze**: Read `README.md`, `project.md`, and this file.
2.  **Plan**: Check `STYLE.md` for conventions.
3.  **Implement**: Use `npm run dev` to test locally.
4.  **Verify**: Run `npm run build` and `npm run lint`.
5.  **Update**: If you implemented a new feature, mark it ✅ in "Current Status" above.
